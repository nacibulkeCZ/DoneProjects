After being refused a business loan by Bank Manager for her failing café,
                 she meets and argues with her high-achieving sister, Claire, at a feminist lecture. She visits her father and godmother, from whose home studio she steals a sculpture of a woman's torso. On a taxi 
                ride home, she recounts how her best friend Boo accidentally killed herself after her boyfriend cheated on her.</td>

She runs into Arsehole Guy, but the awkward sex that ensues makes her run back to her emotionally fragile, on-and-off boyfriend, Harry. Harry leaves her for good, however, after she scares him in the shower, and after he discovers that she has been lying about giving up masturbation.</td>

Fleabag admits to Claire that she stole the sculpture, and Claire asks her to return it. At the retreat, Fleabag runs into Bank Manager, who is attending a neighbouring workshop following a sexual harassment scandal at work. The two bond over their shared unhappiness. Claire reveals that she has been promoted to a lucrative position in Finland, but considers turning it down for the sake of her family.

Fleabag takes the opportunity to restore the sculpture to her godmother's studio. Things get heated, and plans are being made for the godmother's "sex-hibition".

She is dumped by Arsehole Guy, and then discovers that Harry has a new girlfriend. To Fleabag's surprise, Claire has turned down the Finland offer and decides to stay with Martin, who has convinced her that Fleabag made the move at the party. Their confrontation triggers a flashback, revealing that Fleabag was the woman with whom Boo's boyfriend cheated. After being turned away by her father, a heartbroken and guilt-ridden Fleabag contemplates suicide, but is stopped by Bank Manager, who happens to pass by. After listening to her confession, Bank Manager decides to offer her another shot at the business loan for the café.</td>
