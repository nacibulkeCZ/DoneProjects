            <h2>CHARACTERS</h2>
            <h3>FLEABAG</h3>
            <div class="kontejnr">
                <img class="main" src="img/fleabagL.png">
                <img class="hovr" src="img/fleabagN.png">
                <p style="width: 30%; padding-left: 40%;">Fleabag is a bit of an oddball and people are often confused by her dark sense of humor. She maintains a snarky inner monologue that she tries to soften when she interacts with people, but she’s not always 
                    successful at tamping down her acerbic point of view. Though Fleabag can come across as awkward or even arrogant, deep down she has a good heart.<br><br>She has been struggling to find joy in life ever since Boo’s death. She often thinks back on their happy memories together and seems unable to move forward in a health way. Underneath her sarcastic exterior, she’s clearly haunted by a sense of trauma
                    and maybe ever guilt. She wants to get out of her funk and move on with life, but her issues feel too big and terrifying to truly confront.</p>
            </div>
            <h3>CLAIRE</h3>
            <div class="kontejnr">
                <img class="main" src="img/claireN.png">
                <img class="hovr" src="img/claireL.png">
                <p style="width: 33%; padding-left: 5.5%;">Fleabag describes Claire as a “super high-powered perfect anorexic super sister.” Claire needs to be in control at all times. She hates surprises so much that she takes over and plans her own surprise birthday party to avoid others disappointing her. She loves her sister, even though she has a hard time saying that.
                <br><br>She’s got a tense and combative but somehow still close relationship with her sister Fleabag, in large part because they connect over grief for their late mother and strained relationship with father. His method of coping with having two motherless daughters in the wake of her mother’s death was, as Fleabag puts it, was “buying us tickets to feminist lectures, start f**king our godmother, and eventually stop calling.” Their conversations regularly end in bickering because they’re both difficult people and polar opposites.</p>
            </div>
            <h3>THE PRIEST</h3>
            <div class="kontejnr">
                <img class="main" src="img/priestN.png">
                <img class="hovr" src="img/priestL.png">
                <p style="width: 33%; padding-left: 5.5%;">He is charismatic with a blunt personality. He often swears and jokes - unlike the "typical priest". He likes helping people with their troubles, even to the point that it comes as a default. He’s a “cool priest”: he swears, he drinks tequila, he smokes, and he has accepting views about religion and sex. He’s also funny—he jokes that he’s only in the priesthood for the outfits. And he's compassionate and a good listener. 
                <br><br>The Priest argues that “celibacy is a lot less complicated than romantic relationships.” Even after becoming a priest, though, he’s been no stranger to flirtatious relationships and temptation. But they’ve gone nowhere. Lately, though, he’s found it can be difficult to stand firm in his convictions in the face of a strong connection.  If he meets someone he likes, like Fleabag, he says, they’ll “talk and laugh and drink and I’ll give them Bibles and hope that eventually they’ll leave me alone.”</p>
            </div>
            <h3>MARTIN</h3>
            <div class="kontejnr">
                <img class="main" src="img/husbandN.png">
                <img class="hovr" src="img/martinL.png">
                <p style="width: 30%; padding-left: 5.5%;">Martin is flat-out abusive toward everyone. His personality is best described as vulgar and offensive. He constantly belittles Fleabag, despite attempting to kiss her on his wife's birthday. He is an alcoholic. He has described himself as a "good guy" with a "bad personality." Martin is an art expert and dealer, and is married to Claire. He has a son, Jake, who he has custody of from a previous marriage. He is despised by Fleabag, 
                    causing Fleabag to grimace every time she sees him or hears his name. <br><br>Martin is the kind of man who will make an offensive joke, and then blame you for getting offended. One could say, Martin, for all his flaws and faults, actually loves his wife Claire. Belinda said, "I feel like you can love someone and still treat them like shit. Just means you're a d**khead."</p>
            </div>
            <h3>DAD AND GODMOTHER</h3>
            <div class="kontejnr">
                <img class="main" src="img/familyN.png">
                <img class="hovr" src="img/familyL.png">
                <p style="width: 34%; padding-left: 8%;">Dad is the father of Fleabag and Claire. His first wife died of cancer and he remarried his daughter's Godmother. It's clear that he was deeply affected by the death of his wife and the girls' mother, but when it came time for him to step up and be their sole parent, he was not up for the challenge. He is a man who has an extremely difficult time sharing his emotions and offering fatherly words of advice and warmth to his daughters.<br><br>
                    Godmother is one of the most entertaining yet infuriating characters on the show. She presents herself as an extremely positive and warm person, but she can be horribly mean through her passive-aggressive ways. She is especially mean to Fleabag in this manner, making comments and putting her in situations, knowing full well how insulting she is being.</p>
            </div>
            <h3>BOO</h3>
            <div class="kontejnr">
                <img class="main" src="img/boo2.png">
                <img class="hovr" src="img/boo1.png">
                <p style="width: 33%; padding-left: 5%;">Boo accidentally killed herself after learning that her boyfriend had cheated on her. She intended to injure herself by stepping out into a bike lane, but the resulting crash caused the death of three people, including Boo. Boo was Fleabag’s everything; her number one. Boo seemed like the perfect match for our imperfect Fleabag, displaying a similar quirky personality and humor. An original, Boo developed an endearing obsession with guinea pigs after being gifted one by Fleabag. She soon transformed the cafe she and Fleabag founded together into a guinea pig themed one.<br><br>
                    We meet Boo through flashbacks, like Fleabag’s memories, and during these scenes, Fleabag never acknowledges the viewer. She does not need to, because in these memories, Boo is that person that Fleabag can be herself with.</p>
