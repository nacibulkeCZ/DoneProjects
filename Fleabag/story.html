While Claire loves working in Finland, her relationship with alcoholic Martin is worse than ever. Fleabag’s Father and Godmother are now engaged. Fleabag finds a kindred spirit at the dinner table in the form of Hot Priest, the man who will be marrying Father and Godmother at their wedding. Like Fleabag, his pain and healing comes out in the form of socially-inappropriate honesty, often with a comedic twist."
